<p>The internet is at the same time better and worse than it used to be in the '90s.</p>
<p>We don't need huge websites and massive frameworks to convey ideas.</p>
<p>We don't need excessive images, styling and scripts.</p>
<p>We probably don't need libraries for basic stuff that can be done in vanilla JS.</p>
<p>Fancy CSS is still nice, but only if we drop unused code instead of including all of Bootstrap or something.</p>
